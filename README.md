# Libft - My 42 School Project Journey ðŸ“š

## Description
Libft was a pivotal project during my time at 42 School, providing an enriching experience that significantly deepened my understanding of C programming. This project challenged me to create a library containing various functions that mirror and extend the functionalities of the standard C library.

## My Learning Journey ðŸš€
Throughout the development of Libft, I delved into several key areas:
1. **Memory Manipulation:** I gained insight into memory management techniques through functions like `ft_memset` and `ft_memcpy`, which enabled me to manipulate memory efficiently.
   
2. **String Manipulation:** Exploring functions like `ft_strlen` and `ft_strcpy` honed my skills in handling strings, allowing me to work more effectively with textual data.

3. **Character Manipulation:** Functions such as `ft_isalpha` and `ft_toupper` empowered me to manipulate individual characters with precision, expanding my repertoire of text-processing tools.

4. **Linked Lists:** Developing functions like `ft_lstnew` and `ft_lstadd_back` provided valuable experience in implementing basic data structures, enhancing my understanding of linked list operations.

5. **Additional Functions:** Crafting custom functions tailored to specific needs broadened my programming horizons, as I tackled diverse challenges and devised elegant solutions.

## Reflection ðŸ¤”
The journey of building Libft was not merely about writing code; it was a journey of growth and discovery. Through countless hours of coding and debugging, I refined my problem-solving skills, cultivated a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of C programming, and emerged as a more confident and capable programmer.

## Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Libft served as a foundational project that equipped me with essential skills and knowledge crucial for success in subsequent projects at 42 School and beyond. It was a journey marked by challenges, triumphs, and invaluable learning experiences, shaping me into a more proficient and resourceful developer.
